# Regression analysis and resampling methods

## Abstract

We use ordinary least squares, Ridge, and Lasso Regression to fit Franke's function and terrain data from MÃ¸svatn Austfjell, Norway. More specifically, we use polynomial regression models up to degree p=20. The results show that a relatively low polynomial degree of p=5 is sufficient to fit Franke's function. On the other hand, we find that for the highly irregular terrain data, high polynomial degrees of at least p=10 and a penalty method are needed to obtain good results. If a regularisation parameter is then chosen in a refined way, the terrain can be represented well, at least qualitatively.
